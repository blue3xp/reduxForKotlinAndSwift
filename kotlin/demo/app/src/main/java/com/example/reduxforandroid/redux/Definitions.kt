/**
 * A *reducer* is a function that accepts
 * an accumulation and a value and returns a new accumulation. They are used
 * to reduce a collection of values down to a single value
 *
 * In Redux, the accumulated value is the state object, and the values being
 * accumulated are actions. Reducers calculate a new state given the previous
 * state and an action. They must be *pure functions*â€”functions that return
 * the exact same output for given inputs. They should also be free of
 * side-effects. This is what enables exciting features like hot reloading and
 * time travel.
 *
 * Reducers are the most important concept in Redux.
 *
 * *Do not put API calls into reducers.*
 *
 * An *action* is a plain object that represents an intention to change the
 * state. Actions are the only way to get data into the store. Any data,
 * whether from UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as
 * WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.
 *
 * use class or data class to implement Action
 *
 * State is data, we can use any data structure for state

/**
 * A *dispatching function* (or simply *dispatch function*) is a function that
 * accepts an action or an async action; it then may or may not dispatch one
 * or more actions to the store.
 *
 * We must distinguish between dispatching functions in general and the base
 * `dispatch` function provided by the store instance without any middleware.
 *
 * The base dispatch function *always* synchronously sends an action to the
 * store's reducer, along with the previous state returned by the store, to
 * calculate a new state. It expects actions to be plain objects ready to be
 * consumed by the reducer.
 *
 * Middleware wraps the base dispatch function. It allows the dispatch
 * function to handle async actions in addition to actions. Middleware may
 * transform, delay, ignore, or otherwise interpret actions or async actions
 * before passing them to the next middleware.
 *
 * @template A The type of things (actions or otherwise) which may be
 *   dispatched.
 *
 * The Redux store has a method called dispatch.
 * The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object.
 * The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside,
 * and we can call getState() to retrieve the updated value
